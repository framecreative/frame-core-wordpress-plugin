# Changelog

## Frame Core 1.0.10

- added FC_CODE_MANAGED - constant defaults true, Disables plugin installation and displays a notice*

- added FC_SITE_MAINTAINED constant - defaults false, as above and also prevents plugin updates because we manage them.

- added FC_DEV_USER constant - no default Allows us to set a username that is exempt from all admin restrictions.

- set auto minor updates for core so that security patches and translations are installed automatically.
